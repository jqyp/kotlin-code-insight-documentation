# PsiBasedModCommandAction

+ Use when edits to PSI and editor-state operations available through `ModPsiUpdater` are insufficient.
+ Supports high-level operations such as creating or deleting files, presenting a chooser for a subsequent action, updating IDE/project
  settings, and more (see `ModCommand`).
+ Constructed via class-based `PsiBasedModCommandAction(@NotNull Class<E> elementClass)` super-constructor which finds an
  element of the specified type at the caret offset.
+ Note that if you need to bind to several elements, you still need to save additional elements into fields by yourself,
  preferably using smart pointers. Itâ€™s up to you to check the validity of these pointers.
  Also note that the element you get inside `perform()` is a physical element, and you cannot change it directly.
