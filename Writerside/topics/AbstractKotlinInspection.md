# AbstractKotlinInspection

Preferred in cases where the quick-fix cannot be implemented as a `KotlinModCommandQuickFix`.  
For example, when the action must not be invoked inside a write actionâ€”common in quick-fixes that launch multi-step
refactorings.  
Also used when PSI edits and editor-state operations available through `ModPsiUpdater` are not sufficient, and
operations such as creating or deleting files, presenting a chooser for a subsequent action, updating IDE/project
settings, and more are required (see `ModCommand`).
